<h3>MEDIA QUERY</h3>

<!-- @media (max-height: 800px){
    p{
      font-size:10px;
    }
  } -->

<!-- 
    @media (min-height: 350px) { /* CSS Rules */ }
 -->



 <h3>
     Make Image responsive
 </h3>
 <!-- img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  } -->
  The max-width of 100% will make sure the image is never wider than 
  the container it is in, and the height of auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio.



<h3>High Resolution Display = half of the actual pixel</h3>
<style>
    img { height: 100px; width: 100px; }
  </style>

  <h3>Make Typography Responsive</h3>
<p> Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, 
    and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.</p>

<p>The four different viewport units are:

    vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
    vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
    vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
    vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
    </p>

    <style>
        h2{
          width: 80vw;
        }
        p{
          width: 75vmin;
        }
        </style>
