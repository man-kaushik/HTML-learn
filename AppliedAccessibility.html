<h3>Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility</h3>
<img src="doingKarateWow.jpeg" alt="Camper Cat doing Karate">


<h5>
    When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning 
    to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty
     string. Here's an example:
<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
</h5>


<!-- 
    One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which 
    is the main subject of your content. This and the other headings are used in part by 
    search engines to understand the topic of the page.
 -->

 <!-- The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive 
    technology can use to navigate to the main content quickly. -->


    <!-- article is a sectioning element and is used to wrap independent, 
    self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles. -->

    <!-- <div> - groups content 
        <section> - groups related content 
        <article> - groups independent, self-contained content -->


<!--  It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent
      tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages. -->

      <h2>A Word on the Recent Catnip Doping Scandal</h2>
      <p>The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented, and its use as an herbal supplement in competitive ninja circles remains controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought to the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a long-time proponent and user of the green stuff, at the Claw of Fury tournament.</p>
      <p>As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must come from within, with no external influences. My own catnip use shall continue as purely recreational.</p>

<h4>Mak Links Navigable with HTML Access Keys</h4>
<h5>HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or
     bring focus to an element.</h5>
<h6>This includes links, buttons, and form controls.</h6>

<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>



<h2>Use tabindex to Add Keyboard Focus to an Element</h2>
<!-- div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them -->
<div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>
<!-- Note: A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an
     element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. -->


<!-- Use tabindex to Specify the Order of Keyboard Focus for Several Elements -->

<input tabindex="1" type="search" name="search" id="search">
<input tabindex="2" type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" id="submit">
