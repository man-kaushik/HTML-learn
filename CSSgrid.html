<h3>First CSS Grid</h3>
set   display:grid;
<p>Note: In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.</p>


<h3>Add columns in grid</h3>

<p>
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
        grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
      }
</p>



<p>Use CSS Grid units to Change the Size of Columns and Rows</p>

<p>
fr: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,
auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,
%: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container.
</p>
<p>
    grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;
This snippet creates five columns. The first column is as wide as its content,
 the second column is 50px, 
 the third column is 10% of its container,
  and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections,
 two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for the fifth.
</p>



<h4>Create a Column Gap Using grid-column-gap</h4>
<p>
    grid-column-gap: 10px;
This creates 10px of empty space between all of our columns.
    grid-row-gap: 5px;
This creates 5px of empty space between all of our rows.
</p>

<p>
    shorthand property for Gaps
    grid-gap:10px 20px;
</p>
